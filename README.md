# Profile Page

This is my personal profile page.

I built it very quickly, over a weekend.

As a result, the code isn't particularly clean.
There's no sensible architecture pattern, styles and types are partly in the component files, etc., etc.

I realize that this could be improved significantly, but there's a reason for this lack of cleanliness.
The page had to go online as quickly as possible - (GSD) -> Get Stuff Done!, because my friend [Daniel](https://github.com/DaniHolzer) and I are currently building an awesome IT, software, and DevOps landscape.

This meant it was clear from the very beginning that this software product would only have a short life cycle.
So why waste time when there are more important things to do?!
The project doesn't need to be refactored either, as it will simply be replaced soon.
